        "detail": "Antarctica lies around the South Pole, mostly below the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. The continent is huge, over 14 million square kilometers (about 5.5 million square miles),almost twice the size of Australia and similar in area to Pluto. Its coastline stretches nearly 18,000 kilometers (11,200 miles). Most of this coast is covered in thick ice shelves, while other parts are steep ice cliffs, glaciers, or bare rock. Although Antarctica looks like an endless sheet of ice, it also has rivers and lakes. The Onyx River is the longest, and Lake Vostok is the largest subglacial lake, hidden beneath the ice near Russia’s Vostok Station. Scientists believe the water in Lake Vostok is slowly renewed as ice melts and refreezes, roughly every 13,000 years. In summer, some lake edges melt a little, forming temporary pools of liquid water. Both saltwater and freshwater lakes exist on the continent. Antarctica is divided into East and West by the Transantarctic Mountains, which stretch from Victoria Land to the Ross Sea. Almost the entire landmass is buried under a massive ice sheet, averaging nearly two kilometers thick. Only a few ice-free areas remain, mostly near the coasts, such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Ice streams from the sheet flow outward into huge floating shelves, slowly moving ice from the interior to the ocean.",

Satellite and fossil evidence show that it was once a lush landscape filled with rivers, lakes, and animals like elephants, hippos, and crocodiles. This period, called the African Humid Period, lasted roughly from <b>10,000 to 5,000 years ago.</b><br><br>When the climate shifted and rainfall disappeared, surface water evaporated, but much of it sank deep into the ground, trapped in porous rock. That ancient rainwater is what now forms the Sahara's hidden ocean. Scientists sometimes call it <b>fossil water</b>, because it comes from a time when the desert was green. "
